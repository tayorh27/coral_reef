## Description

We designed a user-friendly interface that keeps track of the userâ€™s wellness such as weight, sleep, water intake, etc. The platform will also provide tools and features to help in (a) monitoring and storing daily activities i.e. exercise and diet tracking, (b) providing health tips, and (c) visualizing health records on a chart.

We developed a community platform that also provides a space for users to interact, give comments, share tips and ideas, public display goals achieved, and so on. Also, it provides a reward system whereby users can get rewards based on the number of votes given by other users. Blockchain is used for the reward system.
